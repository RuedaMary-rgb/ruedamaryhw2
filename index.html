    <h2> Week 2 Homework</h2>
<p style="color:tomato;">  Hello, as you can see my name is Mary <br> I dont think I have a favorite artist. I think choosing just one would be impossible
    But if I had to, it would be Laufey. I think she has a beautiful voice. <br>
    Additionally, since I'm a very anxious person, her music helps me unwind and relax. </p>
    <p> One of my favorite lyrics from her is... </p>
    <blockquote> 
        <i>Let me be a dreamer, let me float, I can see the whole world from my own cloud</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p> An ethical value that is most important is compassion and empathy. I think it's important for everyone to understand that no matter<br> the background, color, or difference, we all have, it's important to treat people with respect and kindness.   
     <br> No matter what, we are all human beings.</p>
   
    <p>  I enjoy watching movies. All types: comedy, action, romance. All types, even if it's not in English <br>
         The last movie I watched was called the Intouchable. It's a comedey/ drama French movie. It made me laugh and also cry all at the same time.<br> I would recommend anyone and everyone to watch. </p>
   <p>  One thing you should know about me is that I really love animals. My favorite animal is elephants.</p>
